# Roguelike

Rudimentary ruby roguelike with ncurses-ruby,
built in a test driven fashion to make the ruby reek tool 
complain as little as possible for maximum code cleanliness.

## Installation

    $ gem install roguelike

Eventually this will come with an executable that will need
to live in some bin dir. You cannot really run this thing as
it is at the moment.

## Usage
